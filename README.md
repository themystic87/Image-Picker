# Image-Picker
Instead of using a border to show which images have been selected, use an alternate thumb e.g. if thumbs are for example image1.png, image2.png, image3.png then when a thumb is selected, it should show the selected version of the thumb i.e. image1-selected.png, myImage-selected.png etc. instead of the regular version.
